# Cyclicity
Cyclicity is a project we developed for the hackathon at Microsoft Philippines last February. This project aims to become a modern and incentivized waste disposal system. This project **won 1st place** at that hackathon, so you can say that this is a pretty cool project.

Cyclicity also comes with a mobile app written in Java, for Android users. But, as of now, I currently don't have access to it. This is a Windows desktop program written in C#.
